About
-------------------
Project Description: This Project will be inspired on a fire alarm. The goal of this project is to activate a fire alarm properly and efficiently, 
giving the user feedback on when the fire alarm is about to be activated. To accomplish this, the project will simulate a fire alarm behavior with a DHT11 sensor, 
an LED, and Buzzer. The LED will light up whenever the DHT11 reaches a certain “high, but not worrisome”, temperature*. And when the alarm is activated after 
it reaches a temperature* considered dangerous, the LED will now blink, and the Buzzer will turn on. 
*For this project's purposes, the sensor will be based on humidity
--------------------
Features
--------------------
- An LCD that will print acoording to the state of the fire alarm
- An LED that will blink according to the state of the fire alarm
- A DHT11 that will input temeprature and humidity data
- A buzzer that will output sound when the alarm is triggered
- A matrix keypad that will be used as an overall enable with 2 buttons

Getting Started
-------------------- 
Gather the materials needed, according to the Required Materials
Connect the peripherals correctly. (In this specific project, PF_0 and PF_1 were used as the data pins for the LCD; PD_4 was used as the data pin for the DHT11; 
PC_10 and PC_11 were used as unable and enable, respectively; PC_8 was used as the pin for the LED; PD_7 was used for the Buzzer).

Once system is built and running, a wet paper towel can be used to increase momentarily the humidity measured by the DHT11. An efficient way of doing it is by 
touching the wet paper towel at the sensor. 

The alarm system can be turned on and off by pressing the keys 1 (on) and 2 (off) in the Keypad Matrix.
